One of the things I learned is that when console prints out numbers, it prints them out in strings.
So that helped me a lot with my if else statements when I use operators in there.

Also learned how to properly lay out HTML5 and doing it with the proper elements rather then just always using <div> for every section. Looks much better and more organized.


Yesterday GIT was very confusing for me but Today it completely clicked and figured out how to send my files to the repo in GitHub.

Figured out how to use CSS more efficiently and hopefully less "hacky" then my previous projects.
